      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> {new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)}</p>

      <p>
        This page explains how I (Eugene Venger) collect, use, and protect personal data on
        <a href="https://www.venger.me/"> venger.me</a>. I operate as an independent contractor based in Poland
        and process personal data in accordance with the GDPR.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Controller</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Controller:</strong> Eugene Venger<br/>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Poland<br/>
        <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:eugene@venger.me">eugene@venger.me</a>
      </p>

      <h2>What data I collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact form</strong>: name, email, your message, and selected service interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Email</strong>: if you email me directly, I will process the data you send.</li>
        <li><strong>Site analytics</strong>: privacy-friendly, aggregate usage metrics (see Analytics below).</li>
        <li><strong>Technical logs</strong>: IP address and user agent may appear in server logs for security/abuse prevention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why I collect it (legal bases)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Respond to inquiries and provide proposals</strong> — contract initiation/legitimate interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide and improve the site</strong> — legitimate interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and fraud prevention</strong> — legitimate interest.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> — where applicable (e.g., accounting records).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        I use Umami Analytics, a privacy-friendly and cookieless analytics tool, to measure aggregate traffic and
        content performance. Umami does not track individuals across sites and does not build user profiles.
        Metrics include page views, referrers, devices, and countries in aggregate form.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        The site is designed to work without non-essential cookies. If any cookies are ever used, they will be
        limited to what is necessary for functionality or security. You can block cookies at the browser level.
      </p>

      <h2>How long I keep data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact messages</strong>: up to 12 months after last interaction, or longer if we start a project.</li>
        <li><strong>Business records</strong>: retained as required by tax/accounting law.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics aggregates</strong>: retained for trend analysis without identifying individuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing and processors</h2>
      <p>
        I may share data with service providers strictly as needed to run the site and communications (e.g., hosting,
        email, analytics). These providers act as processors and only process data under my instructions.
      </p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If data is transferred outside the EEA, I rely on appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission’s
        Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights (GDPR)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Access your data</li>
        <li>Rectify inaccurate data</li>
        <li>Erase data (right to be forgotten)</li>
        <li>Restrict or object to processing</li>
        <li>Data portability</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise rights, email <a href="mailto:eugene@venger.me">eugene@venger.me</a>. You also have the right to
        lodge a complaint with the Polish Data Protection Authority (UODO):
        <a href="https://uodo.gov.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uodo.gov.pl</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        I implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. No system is 100%
        secure; risk is minimized by collecting the minimum necessary data and limiting retention.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        This site is not intended for children and I do not knowingly collect children’s data.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        I may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected on this page with an updated
        effective date.
