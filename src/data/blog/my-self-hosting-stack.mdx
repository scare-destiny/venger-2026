description: My self-hosting stack and why I chose it

Over the past year, I've built out a self-hosting setup that handles everything from finance tracking to server monitoring. Here's what I'm running and why I chose each tool.

## Coolify 

A good way to manage self-hosted tools. Recently they've made a direct integration with Hetzner, so now Hetzner servers and VPS can be provisioned, deployed, and managed right in the Coolify UI. 

I spent some hours battling with their reverse proxy, but otherwise it's been a good experience using this tool.

Everything is backed up locally and with Cloudflare R2. 

## N8n

For automation and building agents. That's the tool you've probably heard about. 

## Actual

With this tool, I manage my finances better than I have in decades.

They use envelope budgeting (https://actualbudget.org/docs/getting-started/envelope-budgeting), which I became a fan of. One side effect of long-term use of this tool is that I now get joy and excitement about saving money. 

## Postiz

A tool for social media posting. I have LinkedIn and Threads connected (plan to connect Instagram). It also automatically fetches RSS from my blog. 

Not active there yet, but plan to be!

## Kuma to monitor uptime

Easy, simple, and fun. Just ping my VPS from there and have alerts configured for Telegram.

## Beszel for server monitoring

This is the tool I use to monitor my VPSs (currently have two) and containers. Love its simplicity and nice dashboards.

## Umami for analytics

Simple design, open-source. GA4 is an abomination, especially for small projects, so this is a great minimalistic and effective tool. 

They also have an API, so I configured weekly reports to my Telegram. 

In my opinion, Umami is a good choice for blogs and content-focused sites. For a product, you might consider a tool like PostHog (I wrote about it in another blog post: https://www.venger.me/posts/posthog-vs-clarity-and-hotjar). 

## Telegram for real-time alerts

I use it to receive alerts if VPSs or apps are down. Also for small dopamine boosts I get from every like on my blog posts.

## Namecheap and Porkbun for domain management

Simple and reliable domain registrars.

I manage all of this using two Hetzner VPSs: one for Coolify, and another for everything else. This set up (including backups)
costs me about $20.
